"""
Precomputes two static tables the app ships with, both derived from each tank's
model file under
    aces.vromfs.bin_u/gamedata/units/tankmodels/<id>.blkx
(far too many files to fetch in the browser at runtime):

  data/mobility.json  — id -> horsepower-per-ton. The economy file (wpcost.blkx)
                        caps its `speed` field, so real mobility comes from the
                        physics block here.
  data/gunstats.json  — id -> {"v": muzzle velocity m/s, "c": bore mm}. Drives
                        the Sniper playstyle. Penetration is NOT stored in the
                        game files (it's computed at runtime via DeMarre), so we
                        use the two stored numbers that actually define a
                        long-range gun: the fastest AP shell's velocity (flat
                        trajectory) and the gun's bore caliber. Reaching them
                        needs one extra hop per gun: tankmodel -> commonWeapons
                        cannon .blk -> shell definitions (weapon files are cached
                        since many vehicles share a gun).

Run after a major patch that reworks engines/weights/guns:

    python tools/build_mobility.py

These stats change rarely, so the snapshot can lag the live BR data safely.
The daily VPS cron (tools/vps-mobility.cron) re-runs this into the web root.
